# NQueen_Visualiser
# Overview
N-Queen Visualizer is an interactive tool that visualizes the solution to the classic N-Queen problem. The N-Queen problem is a famous puzzle in which the goal is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides a visual representation of the solutions, making it easier to understand the algorithm and its results.
